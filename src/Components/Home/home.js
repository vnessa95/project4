                        <p>1. Size
                            <br />
                            <span>Have sensitive joints? A thicker mat might be in order. Some students prefer that extra cushion. Remember though, what you gain in comfort you'll sacrifice in stability.</span>
                            <br/>
                            <br />
                            2.Sustainability
                            <br />
                            <span>Cork yoga mats are another example of an eco-friendly mat. If you want to do good while you do yoga, consider a mat that does the least amount of harm.</span>

                               <span>Since you'll probably be spending a lot of time together, set your standards high and aim to fall in love with your next yoga mat.</span>
